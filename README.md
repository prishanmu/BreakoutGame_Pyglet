# Breakout

Assignment for SI 507: Intermediate Programming. Modified a game of Pong into a game of Breakout. 

## What does this code do? 

This code runs a version of the classic game Breakout. You may run the code to start the game by running the "SI507_project4.py" file. 

In order to run this program, you must have the pyglet, random, and math modules installed.
